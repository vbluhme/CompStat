## To-do

- Implement a smoothing spline smoother using LOOCV for selecting the tuning parameter $\lambda$.
  - Using B-spline basis functions and their derivatives from `splines::splineDesign`

- Test implementation and compate with `smooth.spline`.

- Test on real data and simulated data (benchmarking, profiling)

Use matrix decompositions to speed up LOOCV.
